                        <p className='md:text-lg lg:text-xl'>Learning a new language can be challenging, especially when it comes to retaining vocabulary. Our mission is to create a fun and interactive language learning application designed to help users expand their vocabulary and improve their communication skills in the language. We have to create an application for a specific language learning. We have to select any language except Bengali and English. We have selected Arabic.</p>
                        <p className='md:text-lg lg:text-xl'>Our application will help users to overcome the learning challenges of vocabulary in an easier way. Users can start with a simple click. Users will be logged in to see the vocabularies. It will be handled by Firebase.</p>
